# Triangle Trader
WIll look for triangle formations on the 30D Timeframe and place STOP Orders to catch the breakouts

Use at your own risk!

There is no attempt to manage the trade after the STOP has been triggered. This has to be done with a different script

backtest is throttled to 1 Day/hr to not hurt my AWS computation time too much
